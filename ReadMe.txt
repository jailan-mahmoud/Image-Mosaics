Image Mosiacs

Implement an image stitcher that uses image warping and homographies to automatically create an image mosaic. We will focus on the case where we
have two input images that should form the mosaic, where we warp one image into the plane of the second image and display the combined views.

Steps:
	1. Getting Correspondences
	2. Compute the Homography Parameters
	3. Warping Between Image Planes
	4. Create the output mosaic
